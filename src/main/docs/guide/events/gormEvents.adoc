GORM defines a http://grails.github.io/grails-data-mapping/latest/api/org/grails/datastore/mapping/engine/event/package-summary.html[number of useful events] that you can listen for.

To subscribe for an event just define a `Subscriber` that receives the event type as an argument:

[source,groovy]
----
import grails.events.annotation.*
import org.grails.datastore.mapping.engine.event.*
...

class MyService {

    @Subscriber
    void preInsert(PreInsertEvent event) {
        println "GOT EVENT $event"
    }
}
----

NOTE: These events are triggered asynchronously, and so cannot cancel or manipulate the persistence operations. If you want to do that see the section on http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#eventsAutoTimestamping[Events & Auto Timestamping] in the GORM docs
